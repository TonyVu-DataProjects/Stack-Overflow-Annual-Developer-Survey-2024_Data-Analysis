## Overview
The aim of this project is to go through the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 results, identify relevant features needed to answer each analytics question, and represent insights found using graphical tools in Matplot and Seaborn. At the end of the project, we will have a thorough analysis for each question. 

## Dataset
Provide details about the dataset(s) used in the project.
- **Source**: [StackOverflow Survey Results](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).
- **Description**: This is a dataset of the annual StackOverflow developer survey 2024 version which the company asked over 65000 developers worldwide to respond about coding, working, AI and how they feel about all of those topics and more.

## Methodology
**Various data exploratory techniques were used as following:**
1. Descriptive statistics
    - Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, percentiles, and etc.
2. Missing values detection
    - Total missing value counts
    - Heatmap
4. Shape & data types / structure inspection

## Analytics Questions
1. Which industry pay developers the most?
2. How does coding experience affect the level of pay?
3. What's the most popular method of learning to code?
4. Are you more likely to get a job as a developer if you have a master's degree?
5. What are the most desirable AI tools that developers want to work with?
6. What is the most common work setting?

## Results
